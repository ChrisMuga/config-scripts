# Config Scrips

### This file contains developer environment setups for vim and the terminal in general.


##### 1. Make sure to install [Fancy Git](https://github.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git) for your terminal:

> ```bash
> curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git/master/install.sh | sh
> ```

**Troubleshooting**

If you run into such an error:
> ```bash
> sh: line 70: fc-cache: command not found
> ```

Then install `font-config`:

```bash 
brew install font-config
```

or 

```bash
apt-get install font-config
```
